This repo is for my graduation thesis on language typology.
And hope I can graduate in time.

To do list:
1. Implement the pipeline for projection.
2. START WRITING!!!

Update on 27th April:
1. The final version of alignment is finished;
2. The alignment results are retrieved.

Update on 26th April:
Now a code to align all the code is (almost) done.

Update on 22nd April:
Now the prototype if refined further, considering different index cross bible files, though only one language works out from the code with five languages in the same for loop.

Update on 21st April:
1. Now I can get some results from word alignment by writing a command line in terminal;
2. Tried to automate the alignment pipeline of thousands of files. Now I have a prototype that works for a single file.

Update on 20th April:
1. Use stanza to do POS-tagging and dependency parsing on fin-x-bible-newworld.txt to make source languages more diverse;
2. Now I have indexes and (pure) content for word alignment.

Update on 19th April:
1. Find preferred sources based on the json file provided by Robert;
2. Use Stanza to do POS-taging and dependency parsing on deu-x-bible-newworld, eng-x-bible-newworld2013 and fra-x-bible-newworld. (More files to be processed, time permitting.)
