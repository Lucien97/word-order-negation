Update on 18th May:
1. Now I am running the alignment (also with the intersection) on my computer (tired with UPPMAX)
2. The .py file to project pos and dependencies from source language to target language is uploaded.

To do:
1. Wait for the results for fin, fra and ces
2. Continue the work with verb and negative-polarity detection.
