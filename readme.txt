This repo is for my graduation thesis on language typology.
And hope I can graduate in time.


Update on 19th April:

1. Find preferred sources based on the json file provided by Robert;
2. Use Stanza to do POS-taging and dependency parsing on deu-x-bible-newworld, eng-x-bible-newworld2013 and fra-x-bible-newworld. (More files to be processed, time permitting.)

Update on 20th April:

1. Use stanza to do POS-tagging and dependency parsing on fin-x-bible-newworld.txt to make the source languages more diverse.
2. Now I have indexes and (pure) content for word alignment.

To do list:

1. Figure out how to use EFLOMAL to align all the other documents to the languages I've already done pos-tagging and dependency parsing.
2. Start writing something about the method and data chapter of the thesis.
