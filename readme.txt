Update on 20th May:
1. Now I am running the alignment (also with the intersection) on my computer (tired with UPPMAX)
2. The .py file to project pos tags and dependencies from source language to target language is uploaded. (Sometimes there are reoccurring sentences because Stanza sometimes mistokenize the verses. This problem is solved now.)

To do:
1. Wait for the results for fra.
2. Continue the work with verb and negative-polarity detection.
