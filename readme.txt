This repo is for my graduation thesis on language typology.
And hope I can graduate in time.


Update on 19th April:

1. Find preferred sources based on the json file provided by Robert;
2. Use Stanza to do POS-taging and dependency parsing on deu-x-bible-newworld, eng-x-bible-newworld2013 and fra-x-bible-newworld. (More files to be processed, time permitting.)

Update on 20th April:

1. Use stanza to do POS-tagging and dependency parsing on fin-x-bible-newworld.txt to make source languages more diverse;
2. Now I have indexes and (pure) content for word alignment.

Update on 21st April:

1. Now I can get some results from word alignment by writing a command line in terminal.
2. Tried to automate the alignment pipeline of thousands of files. Now I have a prototype that works for a single file.

To do list:

1. To make the automated alignment pipeline work, also considering the different length of bible files;
2. Start writing something about the method and data chapter of the thesis. PLEASE!
